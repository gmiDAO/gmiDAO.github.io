# Notes

Founded by [Dylan Macalinao](https://twitter.com/DylanMacalinao) and [Ian Macalinao](https://twitter.com/simplyianm), [Saber](https://saber.so/) is the leading stablecoin and wrapped assets exchange on Solana. It's mission is to be the liquidity network for cross-chain DeFi. 

Saber's [TVL](https://medium.com/multi-io/defi-explained-the-tvl-metric-99187587f8f0) has just surpassed $700M at the time of this interview - this event makes Saber the second largest app in the Solana ecosystem by TVL according to [Defi Llama](https://defillama.com/chain/Solana).

**Saber's Team background?** 

Dylan Macalina - got into crypto in 2017. Got involved in Meetups to learn more about this "programable money". Worked with Ian at [Abacus](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/abacus-has-attracted-2-million-from-yc-justin-kan-and-coinbase-to-help-startups-and-investors-manage-tokenized-liquidity-programs/) (startup working on tokenized securities). After that, PM for trading at [OKcoin](https://www.okcoin.com/en). After that, Product and Design at [Pipe](https://pipe.com/).

Ian Macalinao - got into crypto in 2013 (high school) - a friend sent him .5 BTC, felt into the crypto rabbit hole, and built a script to mine DOGE. Did not touch it for a while - at the time crypto was just a "mine & trade" game. ln 2017, learnt smart contracts and realised that they allow to do any TradFi service in crypto. Thus, invested in protocols and started Abacus. Then, joined Pipe and spent a lot of time trading in DeFi. Now spends time building protocols and trading.

**What differenciates Saber with other DEXes?**

Ian Macalinao - Saber is optimized for trading [pegged assets](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/pegged-cryptocurrency) on Solana. Before, users had to swap these on traditional AMMs and pay high slippage costs. With Saber, users can swap large sums of pegged assets with very low slippage. 

**Congrats for your clean and self-explanatory UI - the UX is** **awsome!**

Dylan Macalina - in crypto, UIs are usually complicated and UX tends to be bad. We started building by asking the question - what is the simplest product that people want to use?

**How did you get into Solana?**

Dylan Macalina - got involved in [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) and met amazing people in the Solana communitty - good oportunity to learn about Solana. 

Ian Macalinao - I was used to developing in [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/)s and did not want to change. After learning about [Anchor](https://medium.com/everstake/anchor-protocol-for-beginners-how-to-get-started-5b19f54ced6d), decided to switch from working on [Ubeswap](https://ubeswap.org/) to Saber in Solana.

**Where do you see Saber in 5 years from now?**

Team - sees a future where 99% of users think of Saber as a savings account. Expects massive growth coming into DeFi. Institutions are going to look for bridges with security and nowadays Solana is the best candidate - envisions Saber as the main cross-chain liquidity provider. 

**What are you focusing now on Saber?**

Dylan Macalina - focusing on cross-chain swaps so people can integrate their DeFi stack with Solana.

**What is [Wormhole](https://solana.com/wormhole) and how it fits into Saber?**

Dylan Macalina - Wormhole is an ETH/SOL bridge - essential to allow for cross-chain DeFi to happen. People who want to exchange their ETH assets for pegged tokens in Solana can now do it using Wormhole.

**Are you SOL maxis or do you see a cross-chain future?**

Ian Macalinao - sees a cross-chain future. Cross-chain is good for the SOL ecosystem (old chains can wrap into Solana with bridges and tools like Saber)

Dylan Macalina - not a SOL maxi but sees more adoption coming into Solana because of the UX.

**Advice for newcomers?**

Dylan Macalina - start building. SOL community very good at onboarding new people - new Hackathon coming up soon. Learn by doing and ask questons!

**How did you discover Saber?**

Chris McCann - found and checked repo. Phone call. Impresed by the Team's background (very early at Pipe and worked together for a long time before Saber). Simplicity and necesity of the product. Speed of execution - they were ahead on every realease schedule.

The market rewards those who execute and deliver on time - they get traction and succeed in the long run.

(Satosh Satoshi) - **What's going to change in the industry if Saber suceeds?** 

Ian Macalinao - there will be more cross-chain liquidity.  

(Chris McCann) - **Saber just reached $700M in TVL, how does it feel?!**

Team - exceeding all its expectations.
